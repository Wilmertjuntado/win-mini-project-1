                    <p class="p-flow">The architecture of a system is equally, if not more, important than how it looks and works. I leverage design-thinking in every project to get to the best human centered solution to a challenge with data. I design experiences for the user, not for myself.</p>

                    <p class="p-flow">While beautiful ui designs can be subjective depending on the viewer, I enjoy the challenge of creating universally beautiful designs that also leverage micro-interactions. With visual design and prototyping, I get a chance to delight the user aesthetics and motion.</p>

                    <p class="p-flow">Creating something and putting it out into the world is very rewarding.

Learning to measure progress and iterate is important.</p>
